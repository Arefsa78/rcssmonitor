[14.0.0]
  * Reimplemented rcssmonitor using Qt4. Please note that Qt 4.3.0
    or later is required to build the new monitor. The new monitor
		supports the qmake build system. If you have troubles with
		Makefile generated by the configure script, please try
    'qmake && make'.

  * Supported QtOpenGL which render the data onto QGLWidget. If the
    performance is drastically decreased, please try
    `./configure --disable-gl' to disable QtOpenGL.

  * New features:
    - Buffering mode.
      Now, rcssmonitor can buffer packets from rcssserver and display
      them later. This feature will be useful under slow networks.
      But, please note that rcssmonitor is still connected to
      rcssserver with UDP/IP connection. So, the buffering mode may
      not work successfully under unstable networks. If TCP/IP is
      supported in future version simulator, this problem will be
      solved.

     To enable buffering mode, you need to invoce rcssmonitor with
     the following option:

       $ rcssmonitor --buffering-mode on

     If you want to change the cached data size(default value: 100),
     you need to add '--cache-size' option to the command line:

       $ rcssmonitor --buffering-mode on --cache-size 200

    - Supported yellow/red card status.

    - Supported new catch model.

    - Supported foul success probability.

    - Supported new heterogeneous parameters.

    - Interfaces for human referee to change playmode.

    - Interfaces for human referee to give yellow/red cards to
      players.

    - Supported Windows environment.

  * Almost all settings are written in ~/.rcssmonitor.conf (in Windows
    environment, this file is located under the working folder) with INI
    format. You can modify the settgin by editing this file.
